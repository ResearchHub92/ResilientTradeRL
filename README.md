## 📂 Folder Structure

### `source/`  
This folder contains all Python scripts used to implement the core methodology of the project, including network construction, metric computation, and reinforcement learning modules.

### `model/`  
This folder includes the trained models developed using the proposed hybrid framework. It contains saved RL agents, configuration files, and model checkpoints.

### `results/`  
This folder holds the output tables generated by the model, including stability metrics and comparative evaluations across different crisis scenarios.

### `plots/`  
All visualizations used in the research—such as network diagrams, assortativity distributions, and stability curves—are extracted using Python scripts and stored in this folder.
